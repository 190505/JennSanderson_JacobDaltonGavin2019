5/3/19 - For the two days in this week, our group got started on developing the Discord Bot. Our first large issue has come in the form of a major decision in the format of our program. In order to have the bot run constantly, it needs to be hosted seprate from the app. If the bot were initalized in the app, problems would occur as multiple instances of the bot would probably break the program. In light of this, Dalton will be setting up a Microsoft Azure server with the core bot program running on it, Jacob will be in charge of setting up layout and logic within the Android app, and I(Gavin) will start with coding the core bot. The Android app will be used to interface the bot hosted with azure. This will assure that multiple instances of the app can all still send commands to the server, but there is only one instance of the core bot. This is the layout for functionality developed within the first two days. Hope you're happy.
